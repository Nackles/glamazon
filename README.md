# Known Bugs
There are no currently known bugs. There is code I would like to refactor, especially within the command prompt.

# Nice-to-haves
I would like to add the second stage of difficulty to the homework assignment. With this groundwork successfully laid out, I do not expect it to take long barring a horrendous/unknown error.
